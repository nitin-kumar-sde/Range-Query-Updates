# 🌲 Introduction to Segment Trees

A **Segment Tree** is a powerful data structure that enables efficient processing of

- ✅ **Range Queries** (e.g., sum, min, max) over a subarray.
- ✅ **Point Updates** (change a single element).
- ✅ **Range Updates** (update an entire range) using **Lazy Propagation**.

Instead of recalculating values from scratch during each query, segment trees break the array into segments and store **precomputed results** in a **binary tree** format.

## ⚙️ Why Use Segment Trees?

For an array of size `n`

| Operation                | Brute Force | Segment Tree |
|-------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| Range Query (Sum/Min)   | O(n)        | O(log n)      |
| Point Update            | O(1)        | O(log n)      |
| Range Update (with Lazy)| O(n)        | O(log n)      |

When you need to **frequently update** elements and **query subarrays**, segment trees significantly reduce time complexity.

## 🧠 How Does It Work?

A Segment Tree is a **binary tree** where

- Each node represents a segment `[l, r]` of the array.
- The **root node** represents the entire array.
- **Leaf nodes** represent individual elements.
- **Internal nodes** store results (sum/min/max) from their child segments.

## 🔨 Time Complexities
- **Build Time**: `O(n)`
- **Query Time**: `O(log n)`
- **Update Time**: `O(log n)`

# 💤 Lazy Propagation

Lazy Propagation is a **clever optimization** used when performing **range updates**.

## ⚡ Problem
Updating each element of a range takes `O(n)` time.

## ✅ Solution
- Instead of updating immediately, we **delay (or lazily propagate)** the updates until necessary.
- A **lazy array** is maintained alongside the segment tree.
- When a query/update affects a node, we first apply any **pending updates** (stored lazily), then proceed.

## 📈 Use Cases
- Range Increment/Decrement
- Range Assignments
- Range Flips (like in some XOR problems)

## 💡 Time Complexity (with Lazy)
- **Range Update**: `O(log n)`
- **Range Query**: `O(log n)`
